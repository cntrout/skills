# first-interview-prep v1.1

Two deliverables:
- Company & Team Overview (PDF)
- Role Analysis & Interview Prep (PDF)

## How to use
- Provide a job URL or paste the full job text.
- Provide a verified profile (structured or markdown). Facts must be true.
- Specify the focus team (e.g., "Product Management").
- Optionally tune knobs (brevity, specificity, warmth, idiom_density, formality, jitter).

## Guarantees
- No fabrication. Unknowns remain blank and labeled.
- Source links included for verification.
- Natural tone. No emojis, no em dashes, no ellipses.

## Changelog
- v1.1: Tightened inputs/outputs, strict no-fabrication policy, clear sources and degraded-mode behavior.
